The root directory is the directory that contains all other directories and files on a system and which is designated by a forward slash ( / ). Among the other directories that are usually installed by default in the root directory are /bin, /boot, /dev, /etc, /home, /initrd, /lib, /lost+found, /misc, /mnt, /opt, /proc, /root, /sbin, /tmp and /usr.

ls -l /home

or

du -sh file_path
example: du -sh /home

Explanation

du command estimates file_path space usage
The options -sh are (from man du):

  -s, --summarize
         display only a total for each argument

  -h, --human-readable
         print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
To check more than one directory and see the total, use du -sch:

  -c, --total
         produce a grand total





other command:
sudo du -sh /var
or
sudo du - sh /home
